Energi Classic is an attempt to follow the original blockchain at the time of the hard fork on block 437600.
The plan now is to follow the original blockchain with mining and masternodes combined.
Once this is established a hard fork will be done from the original chain to cut out the treasury and backbone awards and distribute it to mining and masternode awards.
